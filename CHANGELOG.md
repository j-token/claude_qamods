# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Korean pane labels and a Korean explanation template; `language` accepts `ko`
- Automatic selection picks Korean labels for Hangul in a question or option label (before kana), and for a Korean Claude Code language or `ko` locale before any question exists

### Changed

- AI explanations are written in Claude Code's own `language` setting (any language, for example Korean), or in the language of your recent instructions when it is unset
- Kana in an option label, or a question without kana, no longer forces a Japanese or English explanation
- The `en` / `ja` / `ko` option fixes the explanation language as well as the labels

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Measured token usage for each AI explanation: input, cache read, cache write and output, with `haiku` or `session` model labels
- Session token total in the full-view toolbar, including re-runs and completed superseded calls
- API-price estimates beside measured usage and the session total, using built-in USD list prices as of 2026-09; `showCost` defaults to `on` and can be set to `off`

### Changed

- **Full context** re-runs replace the selected entry's usage while adding to the session total
- Compact views show the usage line only when a row is available
- English and Japanese token documentation now explains measured usage and session totals

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- `context` option in `/config`: `compact` (default) or `full`
- **Full context** / **全文脈で解説** button (`f`) to replace the selected question's explanation using the whole session
- Context mode labels on AI explanations: `compact context` / `full context` and 「要点のみ」 / 「全文脈」; older entries display as full context

### Changed

- Default AI explanations use Haiku with a compact prompt capped at 12,000 characters and output capped at 1,500 tokens, independent of session length
- Compact context includes the last 3 user prompts, Claude's lead-up text, the last 12 tool summaries since the latest real user prompt, and the questions
- Full context retains the session-model fork and the Haiku fallback when no transcript exists yet
- English and Japanese documentation now explain context settings, the button, privacy and token usage

### Fixed

- Late results from superseded explanation runs no longer replace a newer explanation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- English and Japanese pane labels, notifications and AI explanations, with automatic selection from question text and option labels
- `language` option in `/config`: `auto` (default), `en` or `ja`; automatic selection before a question uses Claude Code's language setting, then `LC_ALL` / `LANG`, then English
- Language stored per history entry, with Japanese rendering for entries saved by earlier versions
- AI explanation for a question asked before the session's first response: falls back to a short `haiku` completion when there is no transcript to fork yet
- English screenshots and a language-switch screenshot in `docs/images/`
- OSS documentation: README (English and Japanese), contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy, issue and pull request templates
- `hygiene` workflow that checks the manifests and scans for personal data
- Screenshots and demo videos in `docs/`

### Fixed

- English text in the compact view wraps at spaces instead of inside words
- A late AI explanation no longer raises an unhandled rejection after the session or module has ended

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- **qa-guide** mod: a side pane for Claude's `AskUserQuestion` prompts
  - compact background view while a question is open: AI summary of the current instructions, why Claude asks, the effect of each option numbered like the dialog, a recommendation, your latest instruction and the tail of Claude's lead text
  - full view after answering: option cards, previews, ✔ on the chosen answer, free-text answers
  - history of the last 20 questions with `p` / `n` / `l` navigation and a history list (`h`)
  - `/qa-guide` command, AI explanation toggle (`a`)
- Marketplace manifest `claude-qamods`
